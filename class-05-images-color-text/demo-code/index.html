            <p>Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. This is unplanned it really just happens. Be careful. You can always
            add more - but you can't take it away. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. All you need to paint is a few tools,
            a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. And just raise cain. There are no limits in this world. Let all these little
            things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Do an almighty painting with us. Son of a gun. You are only limited by
            your imagination. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. When
            things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort
            of just make themselves. Nothing wrong with washing your brush.</p>
